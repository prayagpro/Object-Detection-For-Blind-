# üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Object Detector for Blind People

**Object Detector for Blind People** is a Python-based tool designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting objects in their surroundings and providing audio feedback in real-time.

---

## üåü Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv5 for fast and accurate object recognition.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration:** Announces detected objects to provide instant audio feedback.
- **Customizable Object Classes:** Detect only the objects relevant to your needs (e.g., people, bottles, etc.).
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplified design to ensure accessibility for all users.

Ensure your webcam is connected or that your laptop‚Äôs camera is functional.

### 2. Run the Application
Start the object detection:
```bash
python object_detector.py
```

### 3. Interact
- The application will:
  - Detect objects in real-time.
  - Announce the detected objects through audio feedback.
- Press **‚Äòq‚Äô** to quit the application.

## üí° Customization

### Select Specific Object Classes
You can customize the classes to be detected by modifying the `model.classes` variable in the script. For example:
```python
model.classes = [0, 39]  # Detects 'person' and 'bottle'
```

### Adjust Text-to-Speech Settings
Modify the `pyttsx3` parameters in the script to adjust the audio settings such as:
- **Volume**
- **Speech Rate**
- **Voice**
